# OpenPrescribing JupyterLab Notebook

Welcome to this JupyterLab Notebook from the Bennett Institute. We hope you find this notebook both informative and useful. This Notebook is designed as a template for those wishing to learn and/or practice the access and data analyse of data from the OpenPrescribing data source. For those wishing to learn about how to use this Notebook from scratch (or even a reminder), then please start [here](https://bennett.wiki/) `url needs updating`. Currently, this notebook is only available for Bennett Institute staff, as you need credentials to access the OpenPrescribing data.

## Getting started

1. Open Codespace by clicking on `<> Code ▼` button above
2. Clicking on the `Codespace` tab
3. Click on 'Create Codespace on master`
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for Codespace to build (this can look like a lot is not happening, but be patient)

## Open Jupyter Labs

Once Codespace has finished building, will see the terminal start showing a lot of text. When you see something like the below, press CTRL or CMD and click on the hyperlink. This should start your JupyterLabs Notebook session.
