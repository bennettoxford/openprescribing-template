    "## Mr computer, please translate this!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have mentioned before, we are using the `python` programming language to do all of our database retrieval work. You can use any language you like, but `python` works well with data. Another language you may come across in the data analytics world is `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming langauge is normally a text that is human readable and can be translated by the computer into instructions that it can understand and execute (aka run). And who does this translation? This is where the python `interpreter` comes in. What the python interpreter does is that it reads the code that you have written, translates it to machine readable code, and then executes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## if...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at `if` statements. These are little bits of code that ask `is this question true or false`. There is no middle ground with an `if` statement, you cannot ask for \"how much do you like ice cream?\", or \"on a scale of 1 to 100, how difficult do you find coding?\". You can only asked a question for which there are only 2 responses, like \"is it raining?\" or \"are you a computer?. An example of an if statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i_am_a_computer = True;\n",
    "\n",
    "if i_am_a_computer == True:\n",
    "    \n",
    "rest of code...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As i_am_a_computer equates to true, when you compare i_am_a_computer with True, this is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note, when we compare two values, eg i_am_a_computer and True, we use double equal signs `==`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this translation software, the `python interpreter` is VERY predantic about indentation! What we mean by indentation is one `Tab`, or more, before a line of code. Here is some indentation in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i_am_a_computer = True;\n",
    "\n",
    "if i_am_a_computer == True:\n",
    "    print(\"I am indeed a computer!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is happening on the third line (the if statement) is the python interpreter is translating the `if i_am_a_computer == True:` statement into machine reable code. What the computer is then doing is asking is this statement true (that is what `if` statements do). This is indeed true: `i_am_a_computer == True` is the same as `True == True`. So this if statement is true, which tells the python interpreter to read the associated code with the `if` statement. This associated code is the code just underneath the if statement that is indented once, which in our case is the `print(\"I am indeed a computer!\")`. And that is your first if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB: a tab is the same as 4 spaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other uses of indentation in the python language, so look out for them!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions, not the party kind!\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a collection of code that carries out something. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_together_two_numbers_and_print(number_1, number_2):\n",
    "    sum = number_1 + number_2\n",
    "    print(sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "add_together_two_numbers_and_print(2,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk through this snippet of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the `def` keyword is used to `define` a function. After the `def` keyword and a space, you have the function name (`add_together_two_numbers_and_print` in our case), followed by some arguments (`number_1` and `number_2`) followed by a colon `:`. You then start a new line and indent this line once (eg `sum = number_1 + number_2`). Any other bits of code that are associated with this function are also indented (eg `print(sum)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have `defined` the `add_together_two_numbers_and_print` function, how do we use it. To use a function, officially called `call` the function, we write out the function and give it any arguments it might need. In our case with give it the number `2` and `3`. Notice how this function `call` is not indented. This is important. If you indented the function call it would be considered to be part of the function `definition` and nothing would happen. And so the function is called, with arguments of 2 and 3, the function adds up the two numbers and prints out the sum. Simples!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class is in session\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what happens when you want to have a collection of functions, that is bundle them up so you can reuse them all together. And what happens when you also want to bundle up with these functions different variables. This is where `Classes` come into action. Classes allow you to bundle functions and variables into a reusable block of code. And when you use your class and give it real data for its variables and functions, we call this an object. I wont go into the structure of a Class, not that it is overly complicated, but because there are bigger fish to try!\n",
    "\n",
    "## File that class!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to put all of the code we write somewhere. This is normally a file. In python, a file containing lots of python code is called a `module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package that up!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say you have lots of python files, aka modules. You put them in a folder. This collection of files in folders is called a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File structure\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we have really described above is the code and file structure that is used in almost every python program. You can visualise this structure as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "mypackage/                  ← package\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── __init__.py             \n",
    "├── utils.py                ← module\n",
    "│     ├─ def print_data()   ← function (in side a file)\n",
    "│     └─ def clean_data()   ← function (in side a file)\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── models.py               ← module\n",
    "│     ├─ class Patient:     ← class (in side a file)\n",
    "│     │     ├─ __init__()   ← method (in side a file)\n",
    "│     │     └─ diagnose()   ← method (in side a file)\n",
    "│     └─ class Doctor:      ← class (in side a file)\n",
    "│           └─ treat()      ← method (in side a file)\n",
    "│\n",
    "└── subpackage/             ← sub-package\n",
    "      ├── __init__.py\n",
    "      └── analysis.py       ← module\n",
    "            └─ def run()    ← function (in side a file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can ignore the ```__init__``` bits for now, they just help python understand how things relate to one another and start up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have got to grips with the above definitions and structures, these will be important for when we learn about `import` in the next lesson."
