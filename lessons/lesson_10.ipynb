    "As we have mentioned before, we are using the `python` programming langauge to do all of our database retrieval work. You can use any language you like, but `python` works well with data. Another language you may come across in the data analytics world is `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most languages are shipped to your computer with certain functionality, like `print` to screen, or `store` in memory. A lot of these functionalities just work when you write them out (eg `print(\"Hello World!\")`). \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you write out a piece of code and `run` the code, is that the python `interpreter` reads this codes and executes (runs) it. An `interpreter` is basically a piece of software that reads your code and translates it into computer readable code that then gets executed. So writing:\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of default functionality that the python language does out of the box. Sometimes however you want to use other more advanced functionalities that come in the python `toolbox`, and sometimes you want to use functionalities that you or someone else have created. This is what import is for, where you basically import the functionality you want.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code tells the python language interpreter to \"go and fetch this os library please\". The `os` library, short for `operating system`, gives your code the power to work with files and folders on your computer (or in Codespace of course). \n",
