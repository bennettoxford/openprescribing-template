    "So you have just learnt about how to use python to carry out some basic functionality. There is a lot more to learn about writing code, especially when it comes to the analysis of the OpenPrescribing data. But before we do that, we thought you might be itching to actually get some of this knowledge rich data straight away. And why not. Hopefully by now you have your BigQuery credentials from one of the admin team members. If you do, then please follow the step-by-step guide in the [README.md](../README.md) file of this repo. Once set up, try running the code below."

    "Most people have used a `spreadsheet`, such as Excel or Google Sheets. A spreadsheet has rows and columns. Each row is a single record — perhaps one prescription, one patient visit, or one payment. Each column is a type of information — the patient name, the date, the medicine, or the amount. In this sense, a spreadsheet is already behaving like a simple database.\n",

    "An issue that we come across however is that spreadsheets only go so far. They work okay for relatively small numbers of rows, around the hundred to thousands mark, but when you reach millions of rows, a spreadsheet can slow down, become difficult to share, and sometimes simply cannot open. This is where `databases` come in. A database is built to handle large amounts of information, keep it structured, and let you ask questions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Google BigQuery` is one of these databases, but it is designed for `truly massive amounts of data`. Instead of storing the information on your own laptop, it lives in the cloud on Google’s servers.  You do not scroll through it in the way you would with a spreadsheet. Instead, you ask it questions using the `SQL language`, which stands for `Structured Query Language`. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So, imagine your spreadsheet of prescriptions has grown so large that it will no longer open. With BigQuery, you can still work with it. You could ask, “How many prescriptions were written in 2024?” and BigQuery would return the number in seconds. You could go further and ask, “Break that total down by GP practice” and BigQuery would return a neat table with one row per practice and the prescription totals beside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery is, in short, a database that looks and feels like a supercharged spreadsheet in the cloud. It can handle billions of rows, answer questions in seconds, and allow many people to work with the same information all at the same time."
