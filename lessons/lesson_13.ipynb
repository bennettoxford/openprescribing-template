    "## Antibiotics - give 5 days max\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024, NHS guidance recommended that 60% of amoxicillin prescriptions should be 5-days by March 2025. This is due to evidence showing there is no real benefit of courses over 5 days (for most infections). We can work out if we have hit this target with the data we have in OpenPrescribing. First we need to find out the total number of all amoxicillin prescriptions (we will look at 500 mg tablets). Then we need to work out the number of prescriptions that are 5 days long. Finally, we need to found out the fraction of the two numbers as a percentage.\n",

    "\n",
    "fraction = $\\frac{\\text{numerator}}{\\text{denominator}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So our `denominator`, for the example that we described above, is the number of all amoxicillin prescriptions, and our `numerator` is the number of prescriptions over 5-days.\n",

    "\n",
    "**But, before we do that, let's talk about comments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are just what they sound like, comments. In code, a comment is human reable text that the python interpreter just ignores. Comments in code are there to explain to us humans what some piece of code is going, or why we decided to do things the way we did. There are several ways to create comments, let's look at each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single line comments\n",
    "\n",
    "A single line comment looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# I am a comment that the computer ignores\n",
    "print(\"I am a piece of code that the computer DOES read and executes!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prints out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "I am a piece of code that the computer DOES read and executes!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are using the hashtag `#` for single line comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write several lines of code with a hashtag for each line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# I am a comment that the computer ignores\n",
    "# Me too!\n",
    "print(\"I am a piece of code that the computer DOES read and executes!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triple quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to comment over several lines, you can use triple quotes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "I am a very important comment.\n",
    "Only a human reads me.\n",
    "Done!\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So that was double qoutes `\"`. You can also use single quotes `'`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'''\n",
    "I am also a very important comment.\n",
    "The computers cannot see me.\n",
    "Almost!\n",
    "'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comments in SQL are a little different, even if they reside in your python code. If you want to add a comment to a SQL query, the you use the double hyphens `--` for single lines and the `block` comment `/*  */` for multiple lines. For example, for single lines you could have something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- This part gets all the data\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "-- This part tells the query which database we will be using\n",
    "FROM prescriptions;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And for multiple line comments, we can do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* This select component is different.\n",
    "   It looks at the Quantity column.\n",
    "   And calculates the sum. */\n",
    "SELECT SUM(Quantity)\n",
    "/* But this FROM component is the same as before.\n",
    "   It gets the data from the presciptions database*/\n",
    "FROM prescriptions;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are really useful, especially if you want to add information about your code. Let's use comments to talk through the above OpenPrescribing code."
