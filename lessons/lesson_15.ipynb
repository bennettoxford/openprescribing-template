    "# Lesson 15 - use antibiotics wisely!\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK Health Security Agency developed the UK Access, Watch, Reserve, and Other classification for antibiotics (UK-AWaRe). This classification holds four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access antibiotics** are generally narrow-spectrum and associated with a lower risk of resistance. They are recommended as first or second choice options for common infections and should be readily available.\n",
    "2. **Watch antibiotics** are broader-spectrum with a higher resistance potential. Their use should be limited to specific indications and monitored closely.\n",
    "3. **Reserve antibiotics** are last-line treatments, often reserved for severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. These medicines require strict oversight to maintain their effectiveness.\n",
    "4. **Other**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to see what fraction of all prescriptions are from the **watch** and **reserve** groups, as these should be used cautiously to reduce antibiotic resistence and hence effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the results of the Bennett analysis of the UK-AWaRe [here](https://openprescribing.net/measure/aware_antibiotics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a go at getting the data for the above ask ourselves and plotting it.\n",

    "## Imports and Path objects\n",
