At the Bennett Institute, we like to use code to better understand the complex data that we collect. The data in the OpenPrescribing datasets (a collection of different types of data) gives us lots of insight into how we prescibe for our patients in the NHS, both in GP practices and now in hospitals. We will learn more about `OpenPrescibing` and its new brother `OpenPrescribing Hospitals` in later lessons. First of all, let's get you doing some really simple coding examples..."
