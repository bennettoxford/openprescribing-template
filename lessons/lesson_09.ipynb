    "So you have just learnt about how to use python to carry out some basic functionality. There is a lot more to learn about when it comes to writing code, especially the analysis of OpenPrescribing data. But before we do that, we thought you might be itching to actually get some of this knowledge rich data straight away. And why not. Hopefully by now you have your BigQuery credentials from one of the admin team members. If you do, then please follow the step-by-step guide in the [README.md](../README.md) file of this repo. If you don't have your credentials, please give the admin team a gentle nudge. \n",

    "## Introduction to databases and Google BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people have used a `spreadsheet`, such as Excel or Google Sheets. A spreadsheet has rows and columns. Each `row` is a single record - perhaps one prescription, one patient visit, or one payment. Each `column` is a type of information - the patient name, the date, the medicine, or the amount. In this sense, a spreadsheet is already behaving like a simple database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple collection of prescription data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Patient | Date       | Medicine     | Quantity | Practice  |\n",
    "|---------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| Alice   | 05/01/2024 | Omeprazole   | 28       | Riverside |\n",
    "| Ben     | 06/01/2024 | Paracetamol  | 16       | Hilltop   |\n",
    "| Carla   | 07/01/2024 | Amoxicillin  | 21       | Riverside |\n",
    "| Dan     | 08/01/2024 | Omeprazole   | 56       | Riverside |\n",
    "| John    | 09/01/2024 | Omeprazole   | 0        | Hilltop   |\n",
    "| Helen   | 10/01/2024 | Amoxicillin  | 8        | NULL      |\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue that we come across however is that spreadsheets only go so far. They work okay for relatively small numbers of rows, around the hundred to thousands mark, but when you reach millions of rows, a spreadsheet can slow down, become difficult to share, and sometimes simply cannot open. This is where `databases` come in. A database is built to handle large amounts of information, keep it structured, and let you ask questions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Google BigQuery` is one of these databases, but it is designed for `truly massive amounts of data`. Instead of storing the information on your own laptop, it lives in the cloud on Google’s servers.  You do not scroll through it in the way you would with a spreadsheet. Instead, you ask it questions using the `SQL language`, which stands for `Structured Query Language`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> By the way, a `cloud` or `server` is basically a computer connected to the internet with massive amounts of storage and computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, imagine you have a spreadsheet of prescriptions that has grown so large that it will no longer open. With BigQuery, you can still work with it. You could ask, “How many prescriptions were written in 2024?” and BigQuery would return the number in seconds. You could go further and ask, “Break that total down by GP practice” and BigQuery would return a neat table with one row per practice and the prescription totals beside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery is, in short, a database that looks and feels like a supercharged spreadsheet in the cloud. It can handle billions of rows, answer questions in seconds, and allow many people to work with the same information all at the same time."

    "\n",
    "We have already seen that a spreadsheet is like a database. The terminology translation from spreadsheets to databases are: rows are `records` (one prescription, one patient, one order) and columns are `fields` (the patient name, the medicine, the date, the quantity). With a spreadsheet you scroll, filter, and add formulas. With a database you do something similar, but instead of clicking around you use the query language `SQL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is how you ask questions about the information inside a database. Instead of saying “filter this column” or “sum that column” with your mouse, you write a short text command. The database then reads the command, searches through the records, and gives you the result.\n",

We put this data into an area in the database called a table. Think of a table as the individual spreadsheet tabs on your home computer spreadsheet. We decide on a name for this table of \"prescriptions\" (it could be anything you like really). Now let's say you want to get hold of all of the data in the \"prescriptions\" table. What you would say, in the SQL (pronounced \"sequel\") language is \"give me everything you have from the prescriptions table\". The exact `syntax` for this message to the database in the SQL language looks like this:\n",

    "One final thing for this lesson. You may have noticed the full stops `.` in the FROM line above (ie `FROM ebmdatalab.hscic.ccgs`). These full spots are used by BigQuery (and other databases) as a way to reference tables and the way they are stored. The first element `ebmdatalab` is the `project` your table is stored in, `hscic` is the dataset (basically a folder of tables), and `ccgs` is the actual table you are interested in.\n",
