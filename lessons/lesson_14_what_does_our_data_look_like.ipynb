The results from lesson 13 did not `show` you how things were improving, worsening or even static over time. For this, you need to plot out the data over time. Let's do just that.\n",

We can say \"loop over these things until some state is obtained\" or we can say \"for these things here, do this other thing\". The python `for loop` uses the second idea.
